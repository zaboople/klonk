# Note: javapackager comes with java 8 distributions, but it may not be accessible from the
# command-line until you put the correct directory in your path, i.e. something like:
#    export PATH=$PATH:/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_60.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/
#
# Also note: We are limiting to 98 megabytes heap space below because otherwise it grows continuously
# without garbage collection. Loading large files is so slow that it probably won't make sense to go much
# larger. We are setting up for serial garbage collection as well, because by default we crash every
# 2.5 days otherwise.
